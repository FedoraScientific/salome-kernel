Source code structuration and Unit Tests
=================================================================

You will find here general information on code directories structure,
unit tests associated to the different kind of classes, and how to run
the unit tests.

1. SALOME KERNEL source code structuration
==========================================

1.1 General structure of KERNEL_SRC
-----------------------------------

KERNEL_SRC
   Some README files and configuration tools for build

KERNEL_SRC/adm_local
   Part of the configuration files

KERNEL_SRC/bin
   Python and shell scripts used at run time.

KERNEL_SRC/doc
   Kit for end user documentation production: public interfaces, graphic,
   Python, CORBA. Developper documentation.

KERNEL_SRC/examples
   To be removed.

KERNEL_SRC/idl
   All CORBA interfaces from KERNEL are regrouped here.

KERNEL_SRC/resources
   Configuration files for servers (examples). Icons for Graphic interface
   (to be removed ?)

KERNEL_SRC/salome_adm
   Makefile includes and configuration files (M4 macros)

KERNEL_SRC/src
   The source code (C++ and Python)
   

1.2 Directory src: C++ and Python source code
---------------------------------------------

1.2.1 Basic services non related to CORBA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basics
  A set of general purpose C++ services.

SALOMELocalTrace
  A multithread trace system that allows message tracing on standard error
  or a file. 

CASCatch
  Exceptions and signal handler.

HDFPersist
  A C++ interface to HDF.

1.2.2 Basic CORBA services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logger
  A CORBA server that collects the trace messages from differents CORBA 
  process. 

SALOMETraceCollector
  A multithread trace system derived from SALOMELocalTrace, that sends messages
  to Logger server via CORBA.

Utils
  A set of general purpose services related to CORBA, such as basic CORBA
  exception system.

NamingService
  C++ and Python interfaces to name, store and retrieve CORBA objects

GenericObj
  A generic CORBA interface for CORBA objects, to count distributed references,
  and to allow destruction by client. 

1.2.3 Miscellaneous CORBA servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Registry

ModuleCatalog

DataTypeCatalog

RessourcesCatalog

ResourcesManager

Notification

NOTIFICATION_SWIG

1.2.4 CORBA Containers for SALOME Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Container

TestContainer

LifeCycleCORBA

LifeCycleCORBA_SWIG

1.2.5 STUDY server and related interfaces and tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SALOMEDSClient

TOOLSDS

SALOMEDSImpl

SALOMEDS

2. Tools and principles used for Unit testing
=============================================

**TO BE COMPLETED**

Unit Testing rely on cppunit package for C++ testing, and on unittest module
for Python. See these products for general principles of unit testing.

The cppunit package is optional. When the prerequisite is detected, the unit
tests are compiled.

Unit Tests sources are in directories Test under the src/directories
containing the classes to test.

Test are ordered following the order of directories given above.

Tests can be run as a whole, or for a particular directory. In this case, only
a partial test is run (the classes to test, and the classes used, i.e. the 
preceding test directories).


Today, only some tests are written as an example. There are not yet python
scripts in KERNEL_SRC, but it's a matter of days, there are working scripts
to test LifeCycleCORBA_SWIG interface.
