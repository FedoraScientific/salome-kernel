1. Quick Overview
-----------------

First of all, you have to check (or install if needed) the dependant
software programs on your system. These programs are:

- common development tools as gcc, CMake tool.
- third party softwares used in SALOME building or runtime process
  (python, OCC, VTK, ...)

Further details can be found in sections [2] and [3].

If the dependencies are installed on your system, then you have to set
your shell environment to get access to the software components
(cf. [4]. "Preparing the shell environment").

The next step is to install the KERNEL (cf. [5] "Installing KERNEL"):

::

$ mkdir <kernel_build>
$ mkdir <kernel_install>
$ cd <kernel_build>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<kernel_install> ../<kernel_src>
$ make
$ make install

Where <Mode> is build mode(Release or Debug), <kernel_install> 
is a destination folder to install KERNEL module of SALOME.

Then, the SALOME components GEOM, MED, VISU, ... can be installed
with a similar procedure (cf. [6]).

Eventually, the platform can be run by executing the shell script
runSalome (cf. [7]). Here, somme additionnal variables have to be set
to describe the SALOME runtime configuration (<COMPONENT>_ROOT_DIR,
OMNIORB_CONFIG)

The following provides you with specific instructions for each step.


2. System configuration
-----------------------

SALOME is compiled and tested on differents platforms with native packages:
- Debian sarge
- Mandrake 10.1
- ...

If you have another platform, we suggest the following configuration
for building process:

- gcc-3.3.x or 3.4.x
- CMake-2.8.8 or more

remarks:

- This is the minimum level of CMake, if you need
  to compile all the third party softwares (included OpenCascade 5.2.x).

3. Third-party dependencies
---------------------------

The SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares. The
current version depends on the following list
(versions given here are from Debian Sarge, except OpenCascade, VTK and MED,
which are not Debian packages):

CAS-5.2.4		OpenCascade (try binaries,a source patch is needed)
VTK-4.2.6		VTK 3D-viewer
PyQt-3.13		Python-Qt Wrapper
Python-2.3.5		Python interpreter
SWIG-1.3.24		SWIG library
boost-1_32_0		C++ library (only include templates are used)
hdf5-1.6.2		Files Database library
med-2.2.2		MED Data Format support for file records 
omniORB-4.0.5		ORB used in SALOME
qt-x11-free-3.3.3	Qt library
qwt-4.2			Graph components for Qt
sip4-4.1.1		langage binding software 

And, in order to build the documentation:

doxygen-1.4.2
graphviz-2.2.1


Additionnal software may be installed for optional features: 

netgen4.3 + patch
tix8.1.4
openpbs-2.3.16
lsf-???



3.1 To Do
~~~~~~~~~
- Instructions for installing these software programs can be found in a
  special note doc/configuration_examples/install-prerequis.
- Installation shell scripts are also provided.
  These scripts have to be adapted to your own configuration.

- See doc/configuration_examples/*

In the following, we assume that all the third-party softwares are
installed in the same root directory, named <salomeroot>/prerequis.
Then, your file system should probably look like::

  <salomeroot>/prerequis/Python-2.2.2
  <salomeroot>/prerequis/omniORB-3.0.5
  <salomeroot>/prerequis/qt-x11-free-3.0.5
  ...


4. Preparing the shell environment
----------------------------------

Some variables have to be set to get acces to third-party software
components (include files, executable, library, ...) during building
process and runtime.

The shell file prerequis.sh, embedded in the KERNEL source package,
provides a template for setting those variables. In this example, all the
softwares are supposed to be installed in the same root directory,
named here INSTALLROOT.

Copy the prerequis.sh in a working directory and adjust the settings
to your own configuration. To get the shell prepared, just
execute the following command in the building shell:

$ source prerequis.sh

(we assume here a ksh or bash mode)


5. Installing the KERNEL component
----------------------------------

We use here the notation <kernel_src> to specify the source directory
of the KERNEL component. The shell environment is supposed to have
been set (cf. 4).

Installing the KERNEL from a source package needs three directories:

- the source directory, denoted here by <kernel_src>.

- the build directory, denoted by <kernel_build> in the following. This
  directory can't be the same directory as <kernel_src>.

- the install directory, denoted by <kernel_install> in the following. This
  directory can't be the same directory as <kernel_src> or
  <kernel_build>.

The installing process is:

STEP 1:
  preparing directories

  create the <kernel_build> and the <kernel_install> directories::

    $ mkdir <kernel_build>
    $ mkdir <kernel_install>

STEP 2:
  go to build directory

    $ cd <kernel_build>

STEP 3:
  configure the building process
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<kernel_install> ../<kernel_src>

  Where <Mode> is build mode(Release or Debug), <kernel_install> 
  is a destination folder to install KERNEL module of SALOME.
  Note that <kernel_install> must be an absolute path.

  When the configure process is complete, check the status of cmake build.
  You should not have the errors and warnings. All included products and packages must be found.
  
  If a software get a status "not found", then it's not "seen" in the system:

- the software is not installed, or
- the shell environment is not set correctly. 

STEP 4 :
  Building the binary files

  Execute make in the <kernel_build> directory::

    $ make


STEP 5:
  Installing binary files, scripts and documentation

  Execute install target in the <kernel_install> directory::

    $ make install


6. Installing the SALOME components
-----------------------------------

TInstalling a component <COMPONENT> is done by following the same
instructions as given for the KERNEL, replacing KERNEL by
<COMPONENT>.

You just have to be aware of the dependencies between components:

- MED    depends on KERNEL
- GEOM   depends on KERNEL
- SMESH  depends on KERNEL, MED, GEOM
- VISU   depends on KERNEL, MED
- SUPERV depends on KERNEL

For example, installing the component SMESH needs the previous
installation of the KERNEL component, and then the GEOM and MED components.

The building process uses the variables <COMPONENT>_ROOT_DIR to
localize the dependant components. The variables must be set to the
install path directory of the components <COMPONENT> (ex:
KERNEL_ROOT_DIR=<kernel_install>). 
 
In the above example, the three variables KERNEL_ROOT_DIR,
GEOM_ROOT_DIR and MED_ROOT_DIR have to be set before configuring the
building process of the SMESH component (STEP 3).


7. Runtime
----------

See SALOME_Application_ to define your own configuration of SALOME and run it
on one or several computers. This is the recommended way of configuration.

.. _SALOME_Application: ./SALOME_Application.html

The following explains the general principles.

To run the SALOME platform, the procedure is:

- set the shell environment to get acces to third-party softwares::

   $ source prerequis.sh

- define the SALOME configuration by setting the whole set of
  variables <COMPONENT>_ROOT_DIR. Here, you just have to set the
  kernel and the components you need::

    $ export KERNEL_ROOT_DIR=<kernel_install>
    $ export MED_ROOT_DIR=<med_install>
    $ ...

- define the CORBA configuration file by setting the variable
  OMNIORB_CONFIG. This variable must be set to a writable file
  path. The file may be arbitrary chosen and doesn't need to exist
  before running. We suggest::

    $ export OMNIORB_CONFIG=$HOME/.omniORB.cfg

- run the SALOME platform by executing the script runSalome::

    $KERNEL_ROOT_DIR/bin/salome/runSalome


8. Suggestions and advices
--------------------------

For convenience or customization, we suggest the following organisation:

- chose and create a root directory for the SALOME platform, say
  <salomeroot>.

- install the third-party softwares in a sub-directory "prerequis"

- install the SALOME components in a sub-directory "SALOME2"

- make personnal copies of the files prerequis.sh and runSalome in
  <salomeroot>::

    $ cp <kernel_src>/prerequis.sh <rundir>/.
    $ cp <kernel_install>/bin/salome/runSalome <rundir>/.

  Edit the file prerequis.sh and adjust it to your own configuration.

- define the SALOME2 configuration

  This step consists in setting the KERNEL_ROOT_DIR, the whole set of
  variables <COMPONENT>_ROOT_DIR you need, and the OMNIORB_CONFIG
  variable.

  We suggest to create a shell file envSalome.sh containing those
  settings. Then the configuration consists in loading envSalome.sh in
  the runtime shell::

    $ source envSalome.sh

- When installed with this file organisation, running SALOME is done
  with the following shell commands::

    $ source <salomeroot>/prerequis.sh
    $ source <salomeroot>/envSalome.sh
    $ ./runSalome
