Set of scripts for a SALOME application
=======================================

#     - A SALOME application distributed on several computers needs APPLI
#       directories on the same path ($APPLI) relative to $HOME directory
#       of the user, on each computer.

user scripts:
-------------

runAppli   : SALOME launch (idem runSalome but different name to avoid
             confusion with ${KERNEL_ROOT_DIR}/bin/salome/runSalome

runConsole : a python console in the current SALOME session environment

runSession : a shell in SALOME environment, either interactive (without args)
             or used to run a program (defined by given args)

internal application scripts:
-----------------------------

runRemote.sh : called from remote computer, via ssh, rsh...
               used for instance to create container

envd         : sets SALOME application environment
               sourced by other scripts

The following files must be adapted to your environment and SALOME Application:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SalomeApp.xml        - list of modules, options on server launch and resources...
CatalogResources.xml - configuration of machines used in SALOME application
                       (no need of modules list and path here)

env.d directory must contain the necessary files to source, to define 
the SALOME Application environment :
  (  envd script source these files in alphanumeric order )

For instance,
 atFirst.sh     - general presets
 envProducts.sh - prerequisite SALOME environment
 envSalome.sh   - list of MODULE_ROOT_DIR
